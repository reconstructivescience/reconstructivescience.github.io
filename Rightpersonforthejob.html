        <h2>What Qualities Should I Have?</h2>
        There are many important aspects to a reconstructive scientist, perhaps the most important being that you
        understand
        all the risks that any surgery carries, as well as recognising the health and safety rules. Here are a few more
        important
        qualities:
        <ul>
            <li>Be able to analyse data – scientific, clinical and technical.
            </li>
            <li>Be able to design and sculpt complex prosthetics.
            </li>
            <li>Have an understanding of technology and be able to embrace any new advancements.
            </li>
            <li>Be able to manage treatment programmes for referred patients appropriately.</li>
            <li>Communicate with patients in a reassuring and social way.</li>
            <li>Be calm, as you will often be working in the theatre under pressure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Are you the right person for the job?
