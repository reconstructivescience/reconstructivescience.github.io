            <!-- As a Reconstructive Scientist working as part of
            the NHS, you do a whole array of things at work each day. This can

        <h2>Patients</h2>
        Whilst working, you will experience patients requiring surgery for many reasons such as malformation from
        birth (e.g. born without a jaw), effects of a disease (e.g. cancer), or trauma (e.g. a car accident). You
        could be working on any part of the body, but most commonly it will be the jaw, face and the skull.

        <h2>General Information </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You will design, construct and apply medical devices (such as prosthetics or titanium skull plates) for
                patients; these have to be custom-made and you must remember each job is different.
            </li>
            <li>During an operation, you are required to attend theatre to give advice on the positioning of any
                implants.</li>
            <li>You will work in either a maxillofacial or plastic surgery department within an NHS hospital.</li>
            <li>Nose surgeons, dental technologists and maxillofacial surgeons may form part of your team.</li>

        <h2>An Example Day as a Reconstructive Scientist</h2>
        To start your day, you first meet your patient, who has recently had their nose removed because of nasal cancer.
        You need to assess their complications and explain the procedures to come â€“ e.g. explaining what you need to do
        in order to construct an artificial nose. You take an impression of the face and book subsequent appointments at
        your clinic.
        <br>
        <br>
        Later in the day, you must attend a follow up appointment for another patient, who is recovering from
        reconstructive surgery. This can be very rewarding, knowing you have made a hugely positive impact on their
        life.
