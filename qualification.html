            Reconstructive science goes hand in hand with
            maxilofacial science. To apply for the training programme you must
            have:
            <ul>
                <li>Five GCSEs grade 4–9, including all three sciences</li>
                <li>Three high-grade A-levels</li>
                <li>A degree in dental technology</li>
            </ul>
            Then you
            should work as a Dental Technologist for a few years. Finally then can
            you apply for the NHS Reconstructive Scientist!

        To become a reconstructive scientist, you’ll need five GCSE grades, which must be grade 4 – 9 and must include
        all of the three sciences (biology, chemistry and physics). You must take 3 A-levels and get decent grades to be
        able to apply for an approved degree in dental technology at university. It is of primary importance that you
        check university entry requirements as these may differ between institutions. Then you can apply for the NHS
        Scientist Training Programme, which means extra training to specialise and gain an MSc in reconstructive
        science, but only after you have worked as a dental technologist.
