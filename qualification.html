        <h2>What Qualifications Do I Need?</h2>
        <!-- To become a reconstructive scientist, you’ll need five GCSE grades, which must be grade 4 – 9 
        and must include all of the three sciences (biology, chemistry and physics). You must take 3 
        A-levels and get decent grades to be able to apply for an approved degree in dental technology 
        at university. It is of primary importance that you check university entry requirements as these
         may differ between institutions. Then you can apply for the NHS Scientist Training Programme, 
         which means extra training to specialise and gain an MSc in reconstructive science, but only
          after you have worked as a dental technologist. -->

          <h2>Do I Need Any Experience?</h2>
          It is useful to have some experience in similar conditions, such as working 
          under pressure or carrying out work where precision is key. Most employers 
          would prefer you to have some past experience and in some cases it is mandatory.
